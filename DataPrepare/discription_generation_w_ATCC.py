    1. Species Information: Identify the species to which this strain belongs, specifying whether it is Gram-positive, Gram-negative, Fungi, Archaea, or Protozoa. Describe its notable physiological traits.
    2. Unique Mutations: Describe any distinctive genetic mutations identified in this strain compared to the wild-type strain of the same species, particularly those affecting virulence factors, metabolic pathways, or the plasma membrane. Explain how these mutations modify the bacterium’s behavior, physiology, or pathogenicity, and how they may contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance.
    3. Antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides Resistance: Outline any known antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides resistance mechanisms associated with this strain, including specific resistance genes or mutations. Describe the molecular mechanisms by which these confer resistance to particular antibiotics. Make sure to include the corresponding MIC value if you can find it. If you can't find corresponding MIC and molecular mechanisms, don't mention anything about that and keep your response as concise as you can.
    4. Antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides Sensitivity: Identify antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides to which this strain is known to be sensitive. Explain the mechanisms by which these antibiotics exert their effects on the strain. Make sure to include the corresponding MIC value if you can find it. If you can't find corresponding MIC and molecular mechanisms, don't mention anything about that and keep your response as concise as you can.
    In your response, do not provide a summary; instead, list the information as separate points as follows:
    Species Information: ...
    Unique Mutations: ...
    Antibiotic and antimicrobial peptides Resistance: ...
    Antibiotic and antimicrobial peptides Sensitivity: ...
    References: ... (This is just a place holder section, you MUST Ensure that the description is based on current scientific knowledge and has a reference but don't include this section in your response)
    
    Important Instructions:
    1. Ensure that the description is based on current scientific knowledge and includes relevant references where applicable, do not insert references before the Reference section.
    2. Although the strain ID I provided is from ATCC, the same strain may also be cataloged under different identifiers in other databases, such as DSM, KCTC, NCTC, JCM, or other unique numbering systems beyond these examples. Please make sure to cross-reference these alternative ID systems when searching for relevant information.
    3. Do not include any bulletin points in your response.
    4. If information about the strain is unavailable or cannot be found, JUST respond with ‘None’ in the corresponding section! Do not respond with any further explanation!"""}],
